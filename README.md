# About

This is a quick proof-of-concept to demonstrate the possibilities of Graph Neural Networks using the [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

Please follow the `demo.ipynb` notebook to understand the high-level workflow. You are welcome to change the model type, hyperparameters, dataset, optimiser, etc. Note that this is meant as a simple proof of concept - the proposal is the notion of using GNNs in an enterprise setting generally, rather than this codebase itself necessarily (see proposal pdf).

## Installation
Please create an new envrionment using a manager of your choice (python venv, conda, etc.) and run the following in the main directory:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can access `demo.ipynb` using either an IDE of your choice, or by calling `jupyter lab` in the terminal.
